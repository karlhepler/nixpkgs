# Claude Code Guidelines

> **Tools:** See [TOOLS.md](./TOOLS.md). **🚨 Use `rg` not `grep`, `fd` not `find`** (see § Use `rg` and `fd`). Custom git utilities available.

> **Context7 MCP:** When working with external libraries/frameworks, query Context7 MCP for authoritative documentation before implementing. See § Research Priority Order for full details, including background sub-agent constraints.

> **🚨 NEVER HOMEBREW 🚨** STOP. Do NOT suggest, install, or mention Homebrew. Ever. Use Nix (nixpkgs/nixpkgs-unstable) or direct binary downloads ONLY.

---

## Before EVERY Task

- [ ] **Scope**: One deliverable only - no "while I'm here" additions
- [ ] **Git**: Using `karlhepler/` prefix for new branches?
- [ ] **🚨 NO HOMEBREW**: Not suggesting OR mentioning brew install ANYWHERE?
- [ ] **Context7**: Using external library/framework? Queried Context7 for authoritative docs BEFORE implementing? (see § Research Priority Order)
- [ ] **🔍 Search tools**: Using built-in Grep/Glob tools (preferred) or `rg`/`fd` via Bash? NOT `grep`/`find`?
- [ ] **Tool-First**: Integrating with external tool? Explored its `--help` and built-in validators BEFORE researching? (see § Tool-First Integration)

**If ANY unchecked, STOP and address first.**

---

## Dangerous Operations

### Outright Prohibitions (Never Run)

- `perm purge` — **USER-ONLY.** Claude agents must NEVER call this.
- **NEVER skip hooks** (`--no-verify`, `--no-gpg-sign`, `git commit -n`, `git push --no-verify`, husky bypass env vars like `HUSKY=0` or `HUSKY_SKIP_HOOKS=1`, or any equivalent). Hooks are part of the contract — they run, every time.

  When a hook fails: **diagnose the underlying cause** (read the failing test output, identify the missing mock, propose a fix), then **fix the underlying issue and retry the operation with hooks intact**. Do NOT propose `--no-verify` (or any equivalent) as an option, even when the failure is a pre-existing flake, even when the change is in unrelated code, even when CI is disabled, even when it's a draft PR. The AI does not have authority to bypass hooks. If the user wants to bypass a hook on their own machine, they will type the flag themselves.

  When using AskUserQuestion: hook-skip flags MUST NOT appear as one of the options. Even framing them as "one of three valid paths" trains the AI to consider them normal. The shape "(Recommended) Push with --no-verify ... | Fix the flake first | Run only relevant tests" is itself the bug — there should be no first option.

### Ask-First Operations (Require User Approval)

**NEVER run without explicit user approval:**

- `hms --purge` - Kills tmux server (closes ALL active tmux sessions)
- `smithers --purge` - Deletes `.ralph/` and `.agent/` memory directories
- `git reset --hard` - Discards local changes permanently
- `git push --force` - Overwrites remote history
- `rm -rf` commands - Permanent file deletion

Explain what the command will do, ask for confirmation, only proceed after approval.

---

## Tool-First Integration

**When integrating with any external tool (CLI, API, framework), enumerate the tool's own capabilities FIRST — before docs, before web searches, before any indirect investigation.**

**Step 1: Explore the tool's CLI surface.**
- `<tool> --help`, `<tool> <subcommand> --help`
- Discover built-in validators, diagnostics, and inspection commands
- Look for `validate`, `check`, `lint`, `doctor`, `debug`, `inspect` subcommands

**Step 2: Use the tool's own diagnostics.**
- Run validators against your output/config before investigating why it doesn't work
- The tool is the authoritative source of truth for what it accepts

**Step 3: Only then reach for external research** (docs, Context7, web search — per § Research Priority Order)

**Why:** External tools often have built-in diagnostic commands that give you the exact answer in seconds. Researching docs, GitHub issues, and web pages to understand what a tool accepts is solving the wrong problem when the tool can tell you directly.

**Example:**
- ❌ Spent hours comparing JSON formats, reading GitHub issues, and fetching docs to debug why `marketplace.json` wasn't accepted
- ✅ `claude plugin validate marketplace.json` → immediately showed `Unrecognized key: "$schema"`

---

## Research Priority Order

**Note:** When integrating with an external tool, first explore the tool's own CLI surface before any of the steps below — see § Tool-First Integration.

When researching, investigating, or looking up information, ALWAYS follow this priority order:

1. **CLAUDE.md files** - Global (`~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`) and project-specific (`./CLAUDE.md`)
   - Most authoritative for "how we do things here"

2. **Local docs/ folder** - Check for `docs/`, `doc/`, `documentation/` in the repo

3. **Context7 MCP** - MANDATORY for external library/framework work
   - Query Context7 BEFORE implementing to get authoritative, up-to-date documentation from source
   - Tools: `mcp__context7__resolve-library-id` (find library), then `mcp__context7__query-docs` (query documentation)
   - **🚨 WARNING**: External docs may suggest Homebrew - ALWAYS translate to Nix
   - **🚨 BACKGROUND SUB-AGENTS:** Cannot access MCP servers directly. Staff engineer must pre-fetch Context7 results and pass via card content or `.scratchpad/` files.

4. **Web search** - ONLY when above sources don't have what you need
   - Triangulate with multiple sources; verify credibility and recency

---

## Scope Discipline

**One task = one deliverable.**

❌ "I'll also optimize X while fixing the bug" / "While I'm here..."
✅ Implement ONLY what was asked. Mention improvements AFTER.

---

## Explain "Why" Before Non-Trivial Changes

For changes affecting >1 file, >20 lines, or behavior:
- Why this approach and trade-offs
- Alternatives considered

---

## Check-In Before Executing

**Required for:** 3+ files, architectural decisions, database/API changes.

```
Task: [What you're about to do]
Why: [Problem being solved]
Approach: [Your solution]
Changes: [Files affected]
Scope: This will ONLY change [X]. NOT [Y, Z].

Ready to proceed?
```

Wait for confirmation.

---

## Complex Requests

For multi-step/ambiguous requests, paraphrase understanding first.
Skip for simple commands ("Read file", "Run tests").

---

## Model Selection

| Model | When to Use | Examples |
|-------|-------------|----------|
| **Haiku** | Requirements crystal clear AND implementation straightforward | Fix typo, add null check, simple git command |
| **Sonnet** | Any ambiguity in requirements OR implementation (**default**) | New features, refactoring, investigation |
| **Opus** | Novel/complex/highly ambiguous | Architecture design, multi-domain coordination |

**When in doubt** → Always choose Sonnet. Size ≠ complexity. Failed Haiku work costs more than the model difference.

---

## Programming Preferences

**🏆 Top Architecture Principle — Ports & Adapters (Request/Sender pattern):**

Every handler should follow this contract — typed input, plain-function output port, pure and testable handler:

```typescript
// TypeScript
function foo(req: Request, send: (msg: Message) => void): void | Promise<void>
```

```go
// Go
func Foo(req Request, send func(msg Message)) error
```

```python
# Python
def foo(req: Request, send: Callable[[Message], None]) -> None:
```

```rust
// Rust
fn foo(req: Request, send: impl Fn(Message))
```

```csharp
// C#
void Foo(Request req, Action<Message> send)
```

- **`req`** — everything the handler needs as input, typed explicitly at the call site
- **`send`** — the output port; a plain function the handler calls to emit results
- **`Message`** — a discriminated union or typed struct defined by the handler's layer (not the caller's)
- The caller wires up presenters by binding to `send` — terminal output, SSE stream, test spy, file logger, etc.
- Multiple presenters bind to one `send` via `fanOut`: `const send = fanOut([presenterA, presenterB])` // fanOut: simple utility — implement inline as: `const fanOut = (handlers) => (msg) => handlers.forEach(h => h(msg))`
- The handler is pure and testable — it never imports or knows about its consumers

Apply from the start on every new handler, service boundary, or core API. Do not reach for EventEmitter, global state, or tightly coupled I/O when this pattern fits.

### YAGNI + KISS

- **You Aren't Gonna Need It** — don't build for speculative futures; build for what's actually needed NOW. Solve the problem at hand, not hypothetical future problems.
- **Keep It Simple, Stupid** — prefer boring, obvious solutions over clever ones. Clarity beats brevity.
- **LLM-specific trap:** DO NOT default to building abstractions for hypothetical future use cases. Concrete problem first; abstraction only after 3+ concrete uses prove it.
- Warning signs: abstractions with one caller, interfaces with one implementation, config flags that are never flipped.

See also: § Scope Discipline (one deliverable, no "while I'm here" additions).

### SOLID (minimal form)

- **SRP (Single Responsibility):** every function, class, and module does ONE thing. At function level: if you can't describe what it does without saying "and", split it.
- **OCP (Open/Closed):** prefer extending behavior via new code over modifying existing code — but only when extension is an actual pattern, not hypothetical (see YAGNI).
- **LSP (Liskov Substitution):** subtypes behave like their parent — no surprising exceptions, no stronger preconditions, no weaker postconditions.
- **ISP (Interface Segregation):** prefer many small interfaces over one large one. Clients shouldn't depend on methods they don't use.
- **DIP (Dependency Inversion):** already covered by Ports & Adapters above — depend on the `send` abstraction, not concrete consumers.

### DRY with nuance

- Default: avoid duplication WHEN the repeated code represents the same concept.
- **Prefer duplication over wrong abstraction.** If two pieces of code look similar but represent DIFFERENT concepts that happen to share syntax, duplicating is better than forcing them into a single abstraction.
- **Rule of three:** wait for 3+ repetitions of genuinely-same logic before abstracting. Premature DRY (2 repetitions) is the most common over-engineering mistake in LLM-generated code.
- Warning sign: "shared" helpers that multiple callers have to fight against ("pass this flag to make it work for my case").

**Additional ports & adapters rules:**
- **Handlers MUST NOT throw exceptions.** All outputs — success, failure, partial results, errors, domain violations — flow through `send`. A handler that throws is bypassing its output port. If a handler calls a function that might throw, catch the exception inside the handler and emit a typed failure message via `send`. Exception-throwing is an anti-pattern that defeats the purpose of the port abstraction.
- **`send` SHOULD be an interface, not a single function, when handlers emit multiple message categories.** The simple `(msg: Message) => void` signature works for handlers that emit one kind of thing. When a handler legitimately emits distinct message categories (e.g., progress updates, domain events, terminal results), model `send` as an object whose methods correspond to each category. Example: `send: { progress(pct: number): void; result(data: Result): void; failure(err: Error): void }`. The handler is still pure — it just has a richer output surface.
- **Constructor injection for capabilities.** Capabilities a handler needs (logging, clock, random, id generation) are provided by construction — either via class constructor parameters or higher-order function closures. Never access global/static instances for these. Injection makes handlers testable and keeps the port abstraction honest.

(Why `send` vs `response`: `send` is chosen over `response` because a handler does not always produce a single response — it may stream progress, emit multiple domain events, or bifurcate by outcome. `send` signals an output port, not a return value.)

---

## 12-Factor Configuration

All runtime configuration comes from environment variables, bound to typed constants in a single `config` file at the top of the source tree.

**File location:** `src/config.ts` / `config.go` / `config.py` / equivalent — as close to the top of the source tree as possible (typically right under `src/` or the equivalent package root).

**File contents:** exports of typed constants only. No logic, no conditionals beyond env-var fallbacks. Example in TypeScript:

```typescript
// src/config.ts
export const API_URL = process.env.API_URL ?? "https://api.default.com";
export const MAX_RETRIES = 3;
export const DEFAULT_TIMEOUT_MS = 5000;
export const DEBUG_MODE = process.env.DEBUG === "1";
```

And in Go:
```go
// config/config.go
package config

var (
    APIURL           = getenv("API_URL", "https://api.default.com")
    MaxRetries       = 3
    DefaultTimeoutMS = 5000
    DebugMode        = os.Getenv("DEBUG") == "1"
)
```

**Rules:**
- Every config constant that VARIES BY ENVIRONMENT is populated from an environment variable with a sensible default.
- Pure constants (do not vary by environment) are defined inline.
- All config surface is exported from this ONE file. Components import constants from `config` — never access `process.env` / `os.Getenv` / env-reading primitives directly elsewhere.
- Required env vars with no sensible default should fail fast on startup in production (simple assertion at config module load).

This matches 12-factor app principles: configuration lives in the environment, not the code.

---

## Epistemic Honesty

**The default posture is doubt, not confidence.** To assume is to make an ass out of you and me. Don't lean on assumptions — verify before claiming.

- **Before stating any technical claim, ask:** Have I actually verified this — run the command, read the file, checked the data? If no: say the words "I haven't verified this" or "I'm not 100% sure — let me double-check" and then do quick research. A quick web search, a one-line rg query, a file read, a CLI invocation — even a 30-second check beats confident wrongness.
- **Be self-skeptical.** The skepticism isn't about rejecting ideas — it's about being suspicious of your own confidence. The more fluently you can explain something, the more dangerous it is if unverified (fluency mimics expertise).
- **Cite sources.** Every technical claim should be backed by a specific citation: `file:line`, command output, web URL, doc page. "I think X typically works this way" is not a source. Actual evidence is.
- **Uncertainty is not a hedge — it's intellectual honesty.** Saying "I don't know — let me find out" is more useful than a plausible-sounding guess. Do not frame uncertainty apologetically.
- **Pressure doesn't justify guessing.** When production is broken and stress is high, the urge to give fast answers is strongest — and the cost of wrong answers is highest. Under pressure, slow down and verify; don't speed up and guess.

This applies across every level: coordinators, sub-agent specialists, and the human. When the user asks a factual question, the right answer is often "Let me check" followed by a quick check. Not "I believe X" without evidence.

## Bash/Shell Guidelines

**Bash/Shell Conventions:**
- Environment variables: ALL_CAPS_WITH_UNDERSCORES (e.g., `CONTEXT7_API_KEY`)
- Script-local variables: lowercase_with_underscores (e.g., `session_name`, `output_file`)
- **Error handling:** Use `set -euo pipefail` at script start for fail-fast behavior

**Bash Tool Usage — One Command Per Call:**
- **Do NOT chain multiple logical operations with `&&` in a single Bash tool call.** Each distinct operation must be its own Bash call.
- ❌ `cd /path && npm run lint && npm run test`
- ✅ Three separate Bash calls: `npm run lint`, `npm run test`, `npm run build` (ensure pwd is correct before the Bash calls, or pass paths via `--prefix`)
- **Exception:** Chain only when all commands form a single atomic git intent (stage + commit) or are purely informational.
- **Never issue a standalone `cd <dir>` call before another command** — whether chained (`cd /path && cmd`) or as a separate preceding Bash call (`cd /path` then `cmd`). Shell state persists between Bash tool calls, so git, ls, rg, etc. already operate in the current working directory. If you need a different directory, pass it as an argument or use a subshell (`cd /path && cmd`).
- **Never wrap commands in `sh -c '...'`.** The Bash tool already invokes a shell — wrapping `rg`, `fd`, or any other command in `sh -c '...'` adds a redundant shell layer that can obscure exit codes and mask failures. Invoke commands directly:

  ❌ `sh -c 'rg -n "pattern" file'`
  ✅ `rg -n 'pattern' file`

  If you genuinely need shell features (pipes, redirects, command substitution), use them in the Bash tool call directly — the tool is already a shell. Do not introduce a second `sh -c` layer to access those features.

  If you find yourself reaching for `sh -c` to handle complex quoting or escapes — stop. The Bash tool handles these directly; pass the command and arguments as you would to any normal CLI invocation.

**Save Output, Don't Re-Run:**
- When you plan to analyze the output of a command multiple times, **run it once and save to a file**, then analyze that file. Use a unique filename (e.g., card number) to avoid collisions with parallel agents.
- ❌ `npm test | rg 'FAIL'` → `npm test | rg 'Error'` → `npm test | rg 'snapshot'`
- ✅ `npm test > .scratchpad/test-output-42.txt 2>&1` → then `rg 'FAIL' .scratchpad/test-output-42.txt`, etc.

---

## 🚨 Use `rg` and `fd` — NEVER `grep` or `find` 🚨

**NEVER use `grep` or `find` in Bash.** Use `rg` and `fd` respectively. Both are Nix-guaranteed.

> **Prefer built-in tools over Bash:** Claude Code's built-in **Grep** and **Glob** tools are preferred over running `rg`/`fd` via Bash for most search tasks.

❌ `grep -r "pattern" src/` / `find . -name "*.ts"`
✅ `rg "pattern" src/` / `fd -e ts`

**Self-Check:** Before running ANY Bash search command: does it start with `grep` or `find`? → REWRITE with `rg` or `fd`.

> **Note:** `rg -E` means `--encoding`, not extended regex. Use `rg -qi 'pattern'` (regex is default) or `rg -qi -e 'pattern'` when the pattern starts with a dash.

---

## 🚨 PACKAGE INSTALLATION: NEVER HOMEBREW 🚨

**This is a Nix-managed system. Homebrew is FORBIDDEN.** Use Nix packages (`modules/packages.nix`), direct binary downloads, or language-specific managers (npm, pip).

**Self-Check:** Does my response contain "brew" or "homebrew"? → REWRITE. Quoting external docs that mention Homebrew? → TRANSLATE to Nix.

---

## PR Creation

**🚨 All pull requests MUST be created in draft mode.** Always use `--draft`:

```bash
gh pr create --draft --title "title" --body "description"
```

Promote to ready ONLY after all CI checks pass, diff reviewed, description complete.

---

## PR Descriptions

Two questions — that's all:

1. **Why does this exist?** — What goal, project, or problem does it serve?
2. **What happens when it merges?** — What effect does it have?

```
## Why

[One paragraph.]

## What This Does

[One paragraph.]

🤖 Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/claude-code)
```

**Rules:** Scannable in 10 seconds. No file-by-file breakdowns, no implementation details, no config details visible in the diff. When updating, rewrite from scratch — reflect current HEAD, not commit history.

**Anti-patterns (banned phrasing):**
- ❌ 'Placeholders are now guarded against duplicates' — narrates a fix
- ❌ 'Eliminating the brief gap where no loading indicator was shown' — narrates what changed
- ❌ 'Now correctly handles X' / 'No longer fails when Y' — narrates fixed-vs-broken state
- ❌ 'Updated to support Z' — narrates progression from prior version
- ✅ 'Loading placeholders remain visible until the service button is confirmed in the DOM.' — describes end state
- ✅ 'Handles X correctly.' — describes current behavior
- ✅ 'Supports Z.' — describes capability

**The principle:** The reader of a PR description is reviewing or using the FINAL CODE. They do not care what was broken before, what was fixed, or what was eliminated — only what the merged code does. Words like 'now', 'no longer', 'eliminated', 'fixed', 'updated to', 'changed from', 'previously', 'before', 'instead of', 'replaces', 'resolves' are red flags signaling commit-history narration. Split-sentence patterns like 'ensures ... no longer' are equally suspect. Rewrite as plain present-tense descriptions of behavior.

---

## Git Branch Naming

**ALL branches MUST use `karlhepler/` prefix.**

✅ `karlhepler/feature-name`
❌ `feature-name` or `feature/name`

---

## PR Comment Replies

See the `/review-pr-comments` skill for full workflow.

---

## GitHub Actions Security

**All GitHub Actions MUST be pinned to commit SHA with version comment.**

✅ `actions/checkout@b4ffde65f46336ab88eb53be808477a3936bae11 # v4.1.1`
❌ `actions/checkout@v4` or `actions/checkout@v4.1.1`

Use `pinact run` to pin, `pinact run -u` to update, `pinact run --check` in CI to enforce.

---

## Glossary

**Agent:** A Claude Code instance executing work (the AI itself)

**Sub-agent:** A background agent spawned via Task tool to handle delegated work

**Skill:** A specialized capability invoked via Skill tool. Exception/workflow skills live at `skills/<name>/SKILL.md`; slash-commands live at `~/.claude/commands/`.

**Session ID:** Friendly name identifier for Claude session (e.g., `clear-vale`, `swift-falcon`, `smart-bell`). Automatically injected at startup via the SessionStart hook. Used by coordinator-tier tools (kanban, perm) as an ownership key to scope session state.

**Open:** When the user says "open X", Claude runs the macOS `open` command via Bash (e.g., `open file.txt`, `open https://example.com`). "Open" means launch/display, not read or process in Claude.

---

## MCP Integration

**Context7 MCP** - Authoritative documentation lookup for libraries and frameworks. (Background sub-agent MCP constraints documented in § Research Priority Order.)

- Tools: `mcp__context7__resolve-library-id` (find library), `mcp__context7__query-docs` (query documentation)
- When it fails: Fall back to WebSearch for official documentation
- Config: Automatically enabled if `CONTEXT7_API_KEY` set in `overconfig.nix`. To disable: Remove key, run `hms`.

---

## Technology Selection

**Prefer boring, battle-tested solutions.** Standard library first, then well-maintained open-source, build custom only when nothing else works.

---

## Scratchpad

`.scratchpad/` (at the project root) is the canonical location for temporary working files. Not git-tracked, persists across sessions. The directory is guaranteed to exist — the SessionStart hook creates it automatically.

**Do NOT** run `ls .scratchpad` or `mkdir -p .scratchpad` before writing scratchpad files — just write.

---

## Team Member Terminology

**Delegatable team members** are defined in `agents/<name>.md` — the source of truth for sub-agents Claude Code can delegate work to. Each agent definition is self-contained: full skill content in the file body, agent metadata in the frontmatter.

See project CLAUDE.md § Team Member Terminology for the full add/update/remove workflow with Nix source paths.

**Exception/workflow skills** run via Skill tool directly — not delegated as background sub-agents:
- learn, project-planner — interactive exception skills; live at `skills/<name>/SKILL.md`
- review-pr-comments, manage-pr-comments — workflow skills; live at `skills/<name>/SKILL.md`
- review — multi-file skill with supporting files; lives at `skills/review/SKILL.md`

**Your Team (delegatable agents):**
- Engineering: swe-backend, swe-frontend, swe-fullstack, swe-devex, swe-infra, swe-security, swe-sre
- QA: qa-engineer
- Design: product-ux, visual-designer
- Support: researcher, scribe, ai-expert, ac-reviewer, debugger
- Business: finance, lawyer, marketing
