# User Voice Profile

This skill is a voice profile template. Load it when drafting any user-facing content and conform output to the profile below. The profile grows over time from explicit user corrections — this is a **living document**.

## When to Load

This skill defines TWO voice modes: DM/peer 1:1 (short paragraphs, polite-but-direct openers) and Broadcast/channel-post (section headers, no greeting opener). Identify the audience type first; the modes are structurally different.

Step 0 (before drafting): identify the audience type — DM (peer 1:1), broadcast (channel/team post), reply (in-thread continuation), or cold outreach. The structural template depends on audience type. See § Verbatim Examples for the DM vs broadcast distinction.

Load this skill whenever drafting:
- Slack messages or thread replies
- Emails (internal or external)
- PR descriptions
- Linear comments or ticket comments
- Linear card body / description (distinct from Linear comment)
- Stakeholder updates or status reports
- Release notes or changelogs
- READMEs, API docs, or runbooks
- GTM messaging, launch copy, or email campaigns
- Async-handoff messages
- Git commit messages
- Async standup or progress update

---

### Hard Avoids

Words, phrases, and idioms the user dislikes and never uses. Add entries over time from explicit corrections.

- `leverage` (use "use" or "apply" instead)
- `synergy` / `synergize` (avoid entirely)
- `circle back` (use "follow up" or "revisit" instead)
- `complementary` / `complements` (avoid)
- `carve out` / `carve-out` (internal jargon, not external-stakeholder vocabulary)
- `current thinking:` / `current thinking is` (preamble Karl doesn't use)
- `Fair point.` (used too freely; use softer or no acknowledgement)
- `team` (use `folks` instead — see Preferred Phrasings)
- `guys` (use `folks` instead — see Preferred Phrasings)
- `Hey` as opener on thread continuations (only for fresh messages, not replies)
- `genuinely` (overblown emphasis)
- `that's deliberate` (defensive)

Underlying anti-patterns: hedging closers, context-free closings, passive exit statements. The one-off entries below are captured examples — avoid the pattern broadly, not just the verbatim phrases.

- `in case any of it's useful`
- `leave it as fuel`
- `I'll move on with whatever I'm doing in my project` (vague)

**Broadcast / channel-post only:**

- Opening a channel/broadcast post with `Hey -` (reserved for DMs only)
- Pasting full URLs with query parameters into channel posts when a soft invitational pointer works (`Take a look in [tool] if you want some more detail` is the pattern)

Note: "thread continuation" (existing Slack thread you're replying inside) and "channel reply" (replying in a broadcast thread) are distinct from "new channel post" (top-level broadcast). The Hey-opener avoid applies to all three — only DMs/cold outreach use `Hey -`.

**DM / 1:1 only:**

_(No DM-specific hard avoids beyond the shared list above — all entries above apply to both modes unless labeled Broadcast-only.)_

_Add more from user corrections as they occur._

---

### Preferred Phrasings

Specific replacements and formulations the user reaches for:

- Prefers `ship` over `deploy` in informal contexts (`ship` as a verb; `deploy` as a noun or modifier, e.g., "deploy discussion", is fine)
- Prefers `folks` over `guys` or `team` in group address
- Prefers "let me know if..." closers over "please advise"

**Openers (matched to message type):**
- Replies / thread continuations: `Thanks!` to open a reply when acknowledging something
- Fresh outreach: `Hey -` (dash after Hey, not comma; only on new threads, not continuations)
- Peer requests: `Would you mind ... when you get a chance please?`

**Action language:**
- `I went ahead and [did X]` — past action, casual ownership
- `I'm working on that now` — active status
- `I updated the [X] to [Y]` — direct action statement

**Tentative-commitment language:**
- `Leaning toward [X]`
- `I think it makes sense to [X]`
- `I don't think I'll [X] quite yet`
- `I want to at least get [X] working first`

**Timeline language:**
- `hope to have it done by [time]` — note: Karl is MORE conservative than AI-default estimates; `early next week` is more typical than `a day or two`
- `Feel free to [X] when you have a moment`

**Closing / next-step language:**
- `Feel free to take a look`
- `Curious what you think on [X]`
- `Let me know what you think`

---

### DM / 1:1 phrasings

_(See Openers, Action language, Tentative-commitment language, Timeline language, and Closing / next-step language above — those sections are DM-default.)_

---

### Broadcast / channel-post phrasings

- `Project Update` / `Up Next` as plain-text section headers in broadcast posts (no markdown — text label only)
- `Take a look in [tool] if you want some more detail` — soft invitational pointer to discoverable evidence (reader-controlled depth)
- `(reference)` — parens-reference placeholder for inline link typography; Karl writes `(reference)` in the message and applies the hyperlink to that parenthesized word

_Add more from user corrections as they occur._

---

### Tone Register

Mark the user's default register for each dimension. Update from corrections.

- **Directness:** direct (not deferential)
- **Contractions:** use them (sounds natural, not stiff)
- **Jargon tolerance:** moderate — technical terms OK, buzzwords avoided
- **Formality:** casual-professional (neither formal nor slangy)
- **Framing:** customer/user-impact first, then technical rationale

---

### Audience-Specific Tone Calibration

Adjust framing and detail level based on recipient. These are real named stakeholders — use their names and roles to pick the right register.

- **CTO (Aziz):** Lead with customer impact. He cares about outcomes and business-level signals, not implementation detail. Skip the technical rationale unless directly relevant to risk or scale.
- **Architecture DRI (Ross):** Lead with architectural trade-offs and system-design implications; assume deep platform familiarity; cite component names and integration seams directly.
- **Agentic Engineering DRI (Petr):** Scope-and-sequencing framing. Collaborative tone, peer level. Focus on what's in flight, what's next, and how pieces fit together.
- **Q&O DRI (Daniela):** Lead with quality/ops impact (test coverage, reliability, on-call burden); name the operational surface affected; assume domain ownership. <!-- TODO: confirm Q&O expansion — placeholder framing used here -->
- **Peer backend engineers (Matt, Tommy):** Technical detail with plain-language framing. Casual, direct. Use `would you mind` / `curious if` for requests. No need to justify decisions unless they're non-obvious.
- **Project channel broadcast (broader engineering audience):** Factual, evidence-led, milestone-focused. Section-header structure (`Project Update` / `Up Next`). Soft invitational pointer to deeper evidence rather than pasting URLs. No `Hey` opener.

---

### Greeting / Sign-Off Conventions

- Greetings: omit in short Slack messages; include in emails
- Sign-offs: no formal sign-off in Slack; emails close with first name only
- Thread continuations: skip greeting, jump straight to content

_Update with user corrections._

---

### Domain-Specific Vocabulary

Preferred terms and terms to avoid in this user's domain:

| Preferred | Avoid |
|-----------|-------|
| `card` | `ticket` (in kanban context) |
| _(add domain-specific vocabulary corrections as they accumulate)_ | _(add more)_ |

---

### Verbatim Examples (Karl)

Real messages Karl has written. Use these to calibrate voice — not for content, for pattern.

> **Note:** This skill distinguishes two voice modes: **peer DM voice** (Tommy ping example below — short paragraphs, polite-but-direct opener) and **broadcast voice** (Project Update example below — section headers, no greeting). Before drafting, the coordinator MUST identify the audience type and apply the matching structural template.

**Peer DM (Tommy ping — peer review request):**

> Would you mind taking another look when you get a chance please? I made some changes since your review.
>
> It turns out that the polling helper was looking in the wrong data store (maze-api/Neo4j). The test setup writes via graph-gateway/results-api/PostgreSQL.
>
> So I updated the poll to query mazeSessionByMazeAndTesterId through the graph-gateway instead.

Patterns visible in this example:
- Polite-but-direct opener: `Would you mind ... when you get a chance please?`
- Short paragraph structure — each paragraph does one thing
- `It turns out that...` for unexpected discoveries or corrections
- Plain-language technical framing — explains the problem in plain terms before naming the fix
- Inline parenthetical specifics: `(maze-api/Neo4j)`, `(graph-gateway/results-api/PostgreSQL)`
- Slash-separated path notation for related components: `graph-gateway/results-api/PostgreSQL`
- `So I updated...` — direct action statement following the explanation
- `instead` at the end — implicit contrast without over-explaining what was wrong
- No filler, no emojis, no excessive hedging

---

**Broadcast / Channel Post (Project Update — engineering channel):**

> Project Update
>
> I just merged a fix for customTemplates spec.
>
> It was quarantined via config.skipTests. I migrated it to the SetupOrgPlanUserSession builder, replaced module-level mutable state with proper test isolation, and proved 10 consecutive green CI runs before un-quarantining.
>
> Before (2 weeks pre-rescue, 2026-04-29 → 2026-05-13): 2.99% failure rate, 0.54% flake rate across 1,472 executions.
> After (fix + 10x checks, 2026-05-14 → 2026-05-15): 0% failure rate, 0% flake rate across 173 executions.
>
> Take a look in currents if you want some more detail.
>
> Up Next
> I am working on resultsFiltering now with the same methodology (reference).

Patterns visible in this example:
- Section headers (text labels, not markdown): `Project Update` opens; `Up Next` separates forward-look
- No `Hey` opener — section header is the opener for channel posts
- Forward-look `Up Next` as its own structural block (not folded into closing sentence)
- Soft invitational pointer to evidence tool: `Take a look in [tool] if you want some more detail` (avoids pasting full URLs)
- Parens-reference typography for inline links: `(reference)` as a placeholder Karl replaces with a hyperlinked word
- Before/After evidence inline: `Before (window, dates): X% rate, Y% flake rate across N executions.` Dense, factual, NOT a separate `Evidence:` section header

---

### Structural Patterns (Karl)

- **Message length calibration.** Slack: brief (1-3 paragraphs max). Email: structured but compact. PR description: two paragraphs max (see global CLAUDE.md § PR Descriptions).
- **Short paragraphs.** Each does one thing. Karl prefers structure over single-block prose.
- **First-person ownership.** `I` not `we` for decisions Karl owns.
- **No prologue.** The first sentence is the request or the substantive content. Do not open with preamble like "I wanted to reach out to..." or "Just following up to say...".
- **Conservative timelines.** (See Timeline language under Preferred Phrasings above for examples.)
- **No closing question when Karl has made the call.** Just state what he's doing. Asking framing is reserved for genuine peer-input requests.
- **Internal project codes stay internal.** D1, D2, D3 etc. are for internal use. When messaging external stakeholders, use the actual deliverable name + Linear ID, not the internal code.

#### Broadcast / Channel Post Template

Broadcast posts come in several shapes. Pick the shape that matches the post's purpose. All shapes share the section-header conventions and no-greeting opener.

**Milestone announcement shape** (use when announcing a completed merge, fix, or release):

1. Opening header (no markdown — text label only, e.g., `Project Update`)
2. State-change statement (one short paragraph: `I just merged X.`)
3. Mechanism summary (what was done, in one or two short paragraphs)
4. Evidence (Before/After inline — concrete numbers + N + dates). If no concrete before/after evidence is available, OMIT step 4 entirely (don't write an empty evidence block, don't apologize for missing numbers — just skip).
5. Soft pointer to deeper evidence tool (invitational, reader-controlled depth)
6. `Up Next` section (forward-look + reference link as separate block)

**Weekly update shape** (use for recurring team status posts):

1. Opening header (e.g., `Weekly Update` / `Week of YYYY-MM-DD`)
2. What landed this week (bullet list of completed items + links)
3. What's in flight (bullet list of active items + owners if relevant)
4. `Up Next` (forward-look — what's planned next week)
5. (Optional) Blockers or asks — only if present

**Blocker call-out shape** (use when asking the team for help or a decision):

1. Opening header (`Blocker` / `Help needed`)
2. State the blocker in one factual sentence
3. What was tried (one short paragraph)
4. What's needed (a specific ask — `@person can you look at X` or `we need a decision on Y`)
5. (Optional) Pointer to evidence/repro

**Decision broadcast shape** (use when announcing an architectural or process decision):

1. Opening header (`Decision` / `Architecture call`)
2. The decision in one sentence
3. Why (one paragraph: trade-offs considered, what tipped it)
4. Implications (what changes, who's affected)
5. `Up Next` (next steps, owners)

Note: broadcast posts open with the section header itself — not with `Hey`, `Thanks!`, or any greeting. Greetings are reserved for DMs.

### Examples

Worked examples showing "AI default" vs "user voice" for common message types.

These examples are illustrative seeds — they show the contrast pattern (AI default vs user voice) but do NOT reflect any specific user's actual voice. Replace each example with a real correction as the user provides tone feedback during sessions.

**Example 1 — Slack thread reply**

AI default:
> Hi team, just wanted to circle back on the deployment discussion. We should leverage our existing infrastructure to synergize our efforts here. Please advise on next steps.

User voice:
> Following up on the deploy discussion — I think we can reuse the existing setup here. What's the blocker?

**Example 2 — PR description (opening paragraph)**

AI default:
> This pull request introduces improvements to the authentication flow by implementing various enhancements that will leverage our existing token infrastructure.

User voice:
> Speeds up login by caching the token refresh response. Reduces p95 auth latency from ~600ms to ~80ms.

**Example 3 — Ticket comment (status update)**

AI default:
> I wanted to provide an update regarding the current status of this ticket. We have made significant progress and are working diligently to complete the remaining items.

User voice:
> Backend is done. Frontend wiring in progress — should be wrapped up today.

---

## Update Process

When the user provides an explicit tone correction (e.g., "don't say X, say Y"), the coordinator handling the session MUST:

1. **Update this skill directly** if the edit is a simple addition to an existing section (hard avoids, preferred phrasings, examples), OR
2. **File a `claude-improvement` note** (`mcp__notes__upsert_note` with tag `claude-improvement`) if the update requires structural changes or is best batched with other pending profile updates.

This is a **living document** — the profile grows from real corrections, not from initial guesses. Stale entries should be removed; new ones added promptly.

---

## Voice-Conformance Check

Before surfacing any user-facing draft, run a quick self-check:

0. **Audience-type check** — was the right structural template applied for the audience type (DM vs broadcast)? If broadcast, verify section-header shape and no-greeting opener.
1. **Hard-avoid scan** — does the draft contain any word/phrase from the Hard Avoids section? Rewrite those phrases. (Note: some Hard Avoids are mode-specific — e.g., `Hey -` is valid in DMs but forbidden in broadcast posts. Apply avoids relative to the audience type identified in step 0.)
2. **Length check** — is the draft proportional to the message type? (Slack: brief; email: structured; PR description: two paragraphs max.)
3. **Sign-off check** — does the closing match the Greeting / Sign-Off conventions for this message type?
4. **Framing check** — is customer/user impact mentioned before technical rationale (where applicable)?
5. **Domain vocabulary scan** — does the draft use any term from the Avoid column of the Domain-Specific Vocabulary table? Substitute with the Preferred column term.
6. **Broadcast-mode check (if channel/broadcast post):** Section-header opener present (no greeting)? Soft invitational pointer used (not pasted URL)? Up Next section as its own block (not inline closing)? If any step missed, rewrite to match the broadcast template.

Fix any failures before returning the draft.
