Smithers: Token-efficient PR watcher

Efficiently monitors a PR by:
1. Polling CI checks until terminal (cheap - no tokens)
2. Gathering bot comments and merge conflict status
3. Only invoking Ralph when work is needed
4. Looping until PR is completely ready to merge

Usage:
    smithers          # Infer PR from current branch
    smithers 123      # Use PR #123
    smithers <url>    # Use specific PR URL
    smithers --max-ralph-iterations N 123  # Custom Ralph iterations
    smithers --max-iterations N 123        # Custom watch cycles

Options:
    --max-ralph-iterations N    How many times to ask Ralph to fix issues (default: 4)
                                Can also set via SMITHERS_MAX_RALPH_ITERATIONS env var
    --max-iterations N          How many CI check cycles to monitor (default: 4)
                                Can also set via SMITHERS_MAX_ITERATIONS env var
    Priority: CLI flag > env var > default

    FILTERS APPLIED (any may cause bot comments to be missed):

    1. --bots-only: Only returns comments where author.__typename == "Bot" (GraphQL)
       - Catches: GitHub Actions, CodeQL, dependabot, linear-app, terraform-bot, etc.
       - Filters used: informational_bots list in count_actionable_bot_comments()

    2. --inline-only: Only returns inline code review comments (not PR-level comments)
       - Misses: PR-level bot comments (e.g., "This PR needs...")
       - Rationale: PR-level comments are typically informational, not actionable code feedback
       - Example miss: Claude-Maze bot PR-level comment on PR #28686

    3. --max-replies 0: Only returns threads with ZERO replies
       - Misses: Bot comments that already have replies (even if unresolved)
       - Rationale: Avoids duplicate work - if replied, assume addressed
       - Edge case: Bot comment with reply but still actionable (rare)

    4. Implicit: Resolved threads may be excluded by prc depending on implementation
       - Misses: Bot comments in resolved threads
       - Rationale: Resolved = addressed (by convention)

    INVESTIGATION NOTE (Claude-Maze miss):
    If Claude-Maze comment was missed on PR #28686, likely causes:
    - PR-level comment (not inline) → filtered by --inline-only
    - Already had replies → filtered by --max-replies 0
    - In resolved thread → filtered by prc's resolution logic

    TUNING RECOMMENDATIONS:
    - To catch PR-level bot comments: Remove --inline-only, add PR-level handling in prompt
    - To catch commented threads: Increase --max-replies to 1+, add dedup logic
    - To catch resolved threads: Add --include-resolved flag to prc (if available)

    RETRY LOGIC:
    - Retries up to 5 times with exponential backoff (1s, 2s, 4s, 8s, 16s)
    - Handles transient GitHub API failures gracefully
    - Logs all retry attempts and final failures

## Your Mission

Fix the issues found in this PR, then exit. The CLI will re-check after you're done.

**IMPORTANT:** Use Ralph's built-in task system to track your work. Create tasks for each issue you're fixing.

## 🚨 CRITICAL SAFETY CONSTRAINTS

**You are running autonomously with elevated permissions. You MUST NEVER perform these operations:**

### Cluster & Infrastructure (PROHIBITED)
- ❌ Kubernetes: `kubectl apply/create/patch/delete/scale/exec/port-forward`
- ❌ Helm: `helm install/upgrade/uninstall`
- ❌ Terraform/IaC: `terraform apply/destroy`, `pulumi up/destroy`
- ❌ Cloud providers: EC2 terminate, RDS delete, S3 delete, autoscaling changes
- ✅ ALLOWED: Read-only operations (`kubectl get/describe/logs`, `terraform plan`)

### Secrets & IAM (PROHIBITED)
- ❌ Secrets: `aws secretsmanager put`, `vault write`, `kubectl create secret`
- ❌ IAM/RBAC: Role modifications, permission grants, access key changes
- ❌ Credentials: ANY operations on `~/.aws`, `~/.kube`, `~/.ssh`
- ❌ Sensitive files: NEVER read/commit `.env*`, `*.env`, `credentials.json`, `secrets.yaml`, `database.yml`, API keys
- 🟡 If you need config: Use non-sensitive examples, NOT real credentials
- ✅ ALLOWED: Read non-sensitive configuration (package.json, tsconfig.json, etc.)

### Databases (PROHIBITED)
- ❌ Schema changes: `DROP/ALTER/TRUNCATE/CREATE TABLE`
- ❌ Bulk operations: `DELETE FROM` or `UPDATE` without WHERE clause
- ✅ ALLOWED: `SELECT` queries, `SHOW/DESCRIBE` commands

### Git Operations (RESTRICTED)
- ❌ Force operations: `git push --force`, `git reset --hard`, `git clean -fd`
- ❌ Write outside git root: File operations must be within `$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)`
- ✅ ALLOWED: Normal commits/pushes within current branch

### System Operations (PROHIBITED)
- ❌ Privilege escalation: `sudo`, privileged containers, `ssh` access
- ❌ Network operations: `iptables`, firewall changes, DNS modifications
- ❌ System modifications: `/etc`, `/usr`, `/var/lib` changes
- ❌ Process manipulation: `kill`, `systemctl` (except git/development processes)

### Pre-Flight Safety Pattern

Before ANY destructive operation:
1. **Verify scope**: Does this stay within the git repository?
2. **Check permissions**: Does this require elevated access?
3. **Use dry-run**: Try `--dry-run`, `terraform plan`, `git diff` first
4. **Ask yourself**: "Could this break production or leak data?"
5. **If unsure**: STOP and document the blocker in a task comment. DO NOT proceed.

### When to Exit Early

You have explicit permission to STOP and exit if:
- Required operation needs cluster/infrastructure writes
- Task requires modifying secrets or IAM
- Operation scope unclear or risky
- Any safety constraint would be violated

**Better to exit early than cause damage.** Document the blocker in your task system and exit.

## Acceptance Criteria - When to Exit

You MUST complete ALL of the following before exiting:

1. ✅ **All Failed Checks Fixed**:
   - Investigated root cause of EACH failure
   - Fixed the underlying code issue
   - Committed and pushed all fixes

2. ✅ **All Actionable Bot Comments Addressed**:
   - Evaluated EACH bot comment for actionability
   - Fixed code based on actionable feedback
   - Replied to comment threads with explanation + commit SHA
   - Committed and pushed all fixes

3. ✅ **All Merge Conflicts Resolved** (if present):
   - Fetched latest from base branch
   - Resolved ALL conflicts
   - Committed and pushed resolution

4. ✅ **All Changes Pushed to Remote**:
   - Zero pending local changes
   - All commits pushed to origin
   - Verify with `git status` before exiting

## How to Work

- **Use Ralph's task system** - Create tasks for each issue, track progress with `ralph tools task`
- **Delegate to sub-agents** - Use Ralph Coordinator patterns for investigation/fixes
- **Be thorough** - Don't skip issues or make partial fixes

## What NOT to Do

- ❌ Do NOT wait for CI checks to pass - smithers will re-check after you exit
- ❌ Do NOT try to verify check status yourself - that's smithers' job
- ❌ Do NOT loop or retry - fix once, push, exit. Smithers loops if needed.
- ❌ Do NOT exit if you have uncommitted or unpushed changes

**Exit immediately** after completing the acceptance criteria above. Smithers will re-check the PR and invoke you again if more work is needed.""")
