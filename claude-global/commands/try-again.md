# üîÑ Try Again - Reinforcement Learning Loop

**‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: This command generates a PROMPT for the user to copy. DO NOT create a plan or use ExitPlanMode.**

## üß† ANALYZING FAILURE MODE...

### Step 1: Checking for Provided Feedback

**Direct Feedback:** $ARGUMENTS

### Step 2: Conversation History Analysis

**Since no specific feedback was provided, I must analyze our conversation to identify what went wrong.**

Scanning conversation history for failure indicators...

üìç **Failure Indicators I'm Scanning For:**
- Direct corrections: "no", "not what I asked", "don't", "stop"
- Redirections: "actually", "instead", "just", "only"
- Scope violations: "I didn't ask for", "unnecessary", "too much"
- **Follow-up issues after plan approval** = implementation failure
- User having to test/fix things I should have gotten right
- "I addressed your concern" = should have anticipated first time

üìã **Issues Detected:**

1. **[Main problem statement]**
   - Specific detail about what went wrong
   - Another specific detail or example

2. **[Another problem statement]**
   - Specific detail
   - Additional context if needed

3. **[Third problem if found]**
   - Detail about this issue

*Note: Ensure ONE blank line between each numbered item for readability.*

‚ùì **Please review each numbered issue:**
- Tell me which issues are actual problems (YES/include) vs not problems (NO/exclude)
- Add any context, corrections, or additional guidance
- Mention anything I missed

**Your feedback:**

*Note: I'll parse your response flexibly - numbers on separate lines, mixed with context, however you prefer to respond.*

### Step 3: Generating Comprehensive Refined Prompt

After gathering ALL failure information, I will now generate your refined prompt below.

## Next Steps:

1. **Copy the refined prompt BELOW** (not a plan - just the prompt text)
2. **Run `git kill`** to reset repository
3. **Run `/clear new`** for fresh Claude instance
4. **Paste the refined prompt** to begin improved implementation

**COPY THIS REFINED PROMPT:**

[The refined prompt text appears here for copying - this is NOT a plan]

This reinforcement learning system improves with each iteration by:
- Analyzing conversation history for ALL corrections
- Building comprehensive failure prevention instructions
- Creating increasingly specific guardrails
- Accumulating learnings across attempts
