Apply the Changes

# Run home-manager switch to activate the new configuration
hms

This will:
1. Apply all the module changes we've made
2. Reorganize everything according to the new structure
3. Keep all your existing functionality intact

What to Test

After running hms, test these to verify everything works:

1. Shell and Terminal
# Test shell aliases
ll
tree

# Test git commands
git status

# Test custom git commands
git-branches  # (press Ctrl-C to exit)

2. Applications
# Test terminal
alacritty  # Should open with Tokyo Night Storm theme

# Test neovim
nvim  # Should work with all plugins and LSPs

# Test neovide
neovide  # Should open with correct font

3. Verify Theme Consistency
- Alacritty: Should show Tokyo Night Storm colors
- Tmux: Status bar should show Tokyo Night Storm
- Neovim: Should use tokyonight-storm colorscheme

4. Check File Structure
# See the new module organization
tree modules/

# See the reorganized scripts
tree scripts/

If Everything Works

Great! We can continue with the remaining refactoring (Neovim plugins/LSP splitting, final documentation).

If Something's Wrong

Let me know what's not working and I'll fix it immediately. We have full backups and git history, so we can roll back if needed.

Ready to test? Just run hms and let me know how it goes!
